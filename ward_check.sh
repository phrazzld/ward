---DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY SUMMARY---
- Simplicity First: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Modularity is Mandatory: Small, focused components
- Design for Testability: Code must be testable
- Maintainability Over Premature Optimization
- Explicit is Better than Implicit
- Automate Everything
- Document Decisions, Not Mechanics
- Strict Package Structure: Organize by feature
- No Mocking Internal Collaborators
- Structured Logging with correlation_id
- Error Handling: Return errors, add context
- No Secrets in Code
- Conventional Commits

---COMMIT MESSAGE---
$COMMIT_MSG

---DIFF---
$DIFF

Based ONLY on these changes:
1. Does this commit adhere to our development philosophy?
2. Is the code maintainable, testable, and follows Go best practices?
3. Is the commit message following the Conventional Commits spec?
4. Are there any potential issues or improvements needed?

Respond with:
- PASS: If everything looks good
- WARN: If there are minor issues that should be fixed (with bulleted list)
- FAIL: If there are major issues that must be fixed before committing (with bulleted list)
